## Javascript is not Java üßê

---


## Why Javascript 

- The web browser is one of the most used applications on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Largest Meetup Community in Terms of Programming Language
- JavaScript is a lightweight programming language(‚Äúscripting language‚Äù)
- Used to make web pages interactive. 
- JavaScript is also known as browser‚Äôs language.
- Essential for a front end developpement.
- Essential if you want to learn React , Angular and co

## Declare Variables in JavaScript

```JavaScript

const name; // We define a variable called name

```

```JavaScript

const name = "Chris"; // We assign a value to the variable name

```

---
## Basic Data Type

```JavaScript
const name = 'Chris'; // This is a string
let age = 35; // This is a number
let weight = 95.5 // This is a float
const sex = "Male"
const isCycling = true // This is a boolean
```


--- 

## Object Data Type

The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data.

```JavaScript

const car = {
    model: "Opel",
    color: "white",
    doors: 3
    price: "¬£20,000" 
}
```

What is the brand of the car

```JavaScript

console.log(car.model) // output: Opel

```

---

## Array Data Type

An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable.

```JavaScript
let cities = ["London", "Paris", "New York"];
```
```JavaScript
console.log(cities[0]); // Output: London
console.log(cities[2]); // Output: New York
```

---

## Function 

The function is callable object that executes a block of code.

```JavaScript

const greeting = function(){ 
    return "Learn to code @ OpenTechBootcamp"; 
}

console.log(greeting) // output: Learn to code @ OpenTechBootcamp

```

--- 

## The typeof Operator

The typeof operator can be used to find out what type of data a variable

```JavaScript

typeof 15;  // Returns: "number"
typeof '12';  // Returns: "string". Number within quotes is typeof string
typeof 'hello';  // Returns: "string"
typeof false;  // Returns: "boolean"
typeof {name: "Chris", age: 35}; 

```

--- 

## JavaScript Array 

Arrays are complex variables that allow us to store more than one value or a group of values under a single variable name. 

JavaScript arrays can store any valid value, including strings, numbers, objects, functions.

---

## What if we wanted to stored every student name

```JavaScript

student1 = "Mark"
student2 = "Taylor"
student1 = "Chris"

```

--- 

## Let's use an array

```JavaScript

const students = ["Mark", "taylor" , "Chris" ]

```

- An array is an ordered collection of values. 
- Each value in an array is called an element, and each element has a numeric position in an array, known as its index.

--- 

## Accessing an array

```JavaScript

console.log("List of all the students:",students) // output: ["Mark", "taylor" , "Chris" ]

console.log("First student:",students[0]) // output: "Mark"

console.log("Second Students:",students[1]) // output: "Taylor"

```

--- 

## Adding new students 


```JavaScript

students.push("Alice", "Sophie")
console.log(students)  //  output: ["Mark", "taylor" , "Chris", "Alice" , "Sophie" ]

```

--- 
## Removing an element of the array 


```JavaScript

students.pop()

console.log(students.length())  //  output: 4

```

--- 

## Size of an Array 


```JavaScript

console.log(students.length())  //  output: 5

```

--- 

## Creating a String from an Array



```JavaScript

students.join(", ")
console.log(students)  //  output: Mark, taylor , Chris, Alice , Sophie



```

--- 


## Extracting a Portion of an Array



```JavaScript

students.slice(1,3)
console.log(students)

```

--- 


## Excercise 

- Create an array named colors that contains five different names of colors as strings.

- Access the first color in the array and print it to the console using console.log()

-  Now do the same with the third color in the list. (Remember that array indexes start at 0, not at 1!)

- Write one line of code that changes the value of the last color in the list to "ultraviolet" (overwriting the previous value).

- Create a new variable called fourthColor and set it equal to the fourth color in the list.

- Add another color to the end of the list.

- Print the length of the array to the console with console.log()

## Conditions
JavaScript Conditional Statements


--- 

## The if Statement
The if statement is used to execute a block of code only if the specified condition evaluates to true.

```JavaScript

let location = "london"

if (location == "london"){
    console.log(" we are in london")
}

```
---

## The if...else Statement

 Enhance the decision making capabilities of your JavaScript program by providing an alternative choice

 ```JavaScript

 let location = "london"

if (location == "london"){
    console.log("we are in london")
}else{
    console.log(" We are not in London")
}


```
---

## The Ternary Operator

The ternary operator provides a shorthand way of writing the if...else statements

```JavaScript

let location = "london" 

const city = location == "london" ? "we are in london" : " We are not in London"

console.log(city)

```

---

## Loop 

--- 


## forEach (Iterate over arrays)

```JavaScript

students.forEach((student, index) =>  {
	console.log(index); // index
	console.log(student); // value
});

```

---

## The map function


```JavaScript

const cities = ['london', 'paris','berlin', 'rome'];

const joinCities = cities.map((city, index) =>`${index}: ${city}`)

console.log(joinCities.join(', ').toUpperCase()); 

// Output: "0: LONDON, 1: PARIS, 2: BERLIN, 3: ROME"

```



---

## The for...of Loop (Dont work with object)

const codingSchoolName = "Launch22"

```JavaScript

for(let letter of codingSchoolName) {
    console.log(letter); // Output:  L,a,u,n,c,h,2,2
}

```

--- 

## The for...in Loop (Iterate over objects)

```JavaScript

const schoolProgram = { 
    duration: "6 weeks", 
    language: "Javascript" , 
    teacher: "chris" , 
    startingDate = "30.09.19" 
    }

```



```JavaScript

for(var detail in schoolProgram) {  
    console.log("<li>" + detail + " : " + schoolProgram[detail] + "</li>"); 
}

```

---

## Excercise

- Write a forEach loop to iterate through every color in the array and print each color's value to the console.

- Copying from that loop you just wrote, modify it to print every color's value and every color's index in this format: 3, purple or 0, blue etc.


--- 

## Functions

- Functions reduces the repetition of code within a program
- Functions makes the code much easier to maintain
- Functions makes it easier to eliminate the errors

---

## Calling a function

```JavaScript

// Defining function
const sayHello = () =>  {
    console.log("Hello, welcome to OpenTechBootcamp!");
}

// Calling the function
sayHello()

```
--- 

## Adding arguments to the function

```JavaScript

const sayHello = (name) => { 
    console.log(`Hello ${name}, welcome to OpenTechBootcamp!`);
}

sayHello("chris")

```


```JavaScript

const canDrink = (age) => { 
    const checked = age >= 18 ? "Allow to drink":"Not yet"
    console.log(checked)
}

canDrink(18)

```

## Excercise 1

Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

Write a function named tellFortune that:
takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments

---

## Excercise 2

You know how old your dog is in human years, but what about dog years? Calculate it!

Write a function named calculateDogAge that:
takes 1 argument: your puppy's age.
calculates your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years.
outputs the result to the screen like so: "Your doggie is NN years old in dog years!"
Call the function three times with different sets of values.
