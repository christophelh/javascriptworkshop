## How to make a great impact when people find your profile.

As Richard Branson says, you need to find your perfect pitch.

1. Create a Twitter-friendly headline. (Less than 140 characters)
2. Don’t tell people where you are now, but instead tell them who you are.
3. Use simple words, even your grandma needs to understand it
4. Add some swag for illustration images
